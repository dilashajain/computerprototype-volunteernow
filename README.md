Volunteer Now is an application to help potential volunteers to look for volunteering opportunities around their area/locality, and help them to save opportunities they are interested to go ahead with.



Task-

Enter the city of your choice and save volunteering opportunities that interests you. You can go ahead and check all the saved opportunities for further consideration.

1. Enter the name of the city you would like to work for, in the searh bar.

2. Save the opportunities that interests you using the save button at the bottom of each opportunity.

3. Check all your saved opprtunies for future considerations using the 'Saved' tab on the naviagtion Bar.




Scope of the Project

The scope of the project is very similar to the one demonstrated through the prototype.

However, following are few features of the application that were removed as they were difficult to achieve.

1. data.json file is created directly instead of using an API due to a resource constraint.

2. Search Bar on the index.html page is canned(As there is no API in use, having a functional search bar may not be of any use)

3. When the user clicks on the 'Saved' Tab, he/she cant go back to the 'Opportunity' Page.( Although it was not in my project scope, but still i was interested to do it. However, I could not find a way to get the same instance of the 'interest.html' page where opportunities shoudld appear saved)

4. Using Google Maps to display the location. (I am very much interested to do it. But falling short of time as the cookies part was a little difficult and time consuming).
